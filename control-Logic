Car Control Script
The car's movement is controlled using a basic hand gesture recognition system built using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The primary gestures include:

Open Hand (5 fingers): Move the car forward.
Closed Hand (fingers curled): Turn the car in the direction of the closed fist.
Both Hands Closed: Stop the car.
